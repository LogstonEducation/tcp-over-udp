# TCP over UDP

**What is this?** TCP over UDP is an implementation of the Transmission Control
Protocol where UDP is used as the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) in communications.
Why use UDP for layer 2? It's much more portable than dealing with all of the
hurdles associated with raw packets on different operating systems.

**What is the purpose?** This project was developed as a learning and teaching
tool. The focus of the project is on the protocol's state machine and handing
out correct response packets based on incoming packets.

**Does it do all the things?** No. Instead it focuses on a few things. When
there is time, adding things like packet reordering, windowing, and a packet
loss simulator would be logical next steps.
